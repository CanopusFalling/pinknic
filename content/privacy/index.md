Your privacy is our utmost priority. We understand the unique importance of data protection, especially for members of the LGBTQ+ community who may face specific risks from data harvesting. This page outlines exactly what we do (and don't do) to protect your privacy when you visit our website.

## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

We are a community project, not an official entity, and we operate with a deep commitment to transparency and user safety. Our website is built with a "privacy-by-design" approach, meaning we have taken proactive steps to minimize data collection and third-party interactions from the ground up.

## What We Do to Protect Your Privacy

1. **No Cookies or Cross-Site Tracking:** We do not use any cookies on this website. Furthermore, we explicitly avoid all forms of cross-site tracking, pixel tracking, or other technologies designed to follow your activity across different websites. Your visit here remains strictly between you and this site.
2. **Anonymized Analytics with Cloudflare:** To help us monitor the website's performance and ensure a smooth experience for all users, we utilize Cloudflare Web Analytics. This service is designed with privacy at its core:
  - It anonymizes all information, so no personal data is collected or stored.
  - It does not use cookies or any form of cross-site tracking.
  - Its primary function is to provide us with aggregated, high-level insights into traffic patterns and alert us to any performance issues, without identifying individual visitors.
3. **Self-Hosted and Privacy-Managed Fonts:** All fonts used on this website are managed and served directly by Cloudflare, our hosting provider. This means that when your browser requests a font, it does so directly from Cloudflare, rather than from any third-party font provider (like Google Fonts). This eliminates external requests that could potentially track your IP address or other data.
4. **No Personal Information Stored:** There is no need for us to collect or store any personal information about our visitors, and therefore, we do not. We do not have user accounts, databases of visitor information, or any other mechanisms for retaining your personal data from your website visit.
5. **Secure Contact Form (Formspree):** If you choose to contact us via our contact page, your message is securely processed through Formspree.io. Formspree is a privacy-focused service that handles your submitted information privately and securely. We only collect the information you voluntarily provide in the form to respond to your inquiry.
6. **Pure HTML Social Sharing Links:** When you see links to social media platforms on our site, they are simple, direct HTML links. We do not embed any third-party social media JavaScript or widgets. This ensures that social media platforms cannot track your presence on our site before you explicitly click on one of these links and leave our domain.
7. **No Embedded Tracking Content:** We consciously avoid embedding any content (such as videos from YouTube or Vimeo, or posts from Instagram) that might load third-party scripts capable of tracking your activity. All external official links are provided as plain hyperlinks.
8. **Appearance Switcher (Local Storage Only):** This website includes an appearance switcher (for light/dark mode). Your preference for this setting is stored locally within your browser's local storage. This is a non-tracking, client-side function that does not use cookies and does not transmit any information about your preference back to our servers or any third party.

## Your Responsibility When Leaving This Site

While we do everything we can to protect your privacy on this website, we cannot control the practices of external sites. When you click on any of the links provided (e.g., to Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, or the official LGBTQ Sheffield website).

Please be aware that social media platforms are inherently designed to collect user data and may track your activity once you are on their sites. We strongly encourage you to review the privacy policies of any external websites you visit and take your own steps to protect your privacy and safety. We cannot accept liability for any problems you encounter on these external sites.

Many thanks for taking the time to read our privacy policy!
