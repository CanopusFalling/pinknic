Welcome! As you explore this section, I'll be sharing what remains of Pinknic's online presence, striving to provide as much context as possible for each item.

## Exploring The Internet Archive Wayback Machine

The first stop on exploring the digital remains of anything should be the Internet Archive's [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/). It's an absolutely incredible tool that archives websites and provides free access to the past of different websites.

Unfortunately for us it seems the homepage, [www.pinknic.co.uk](https://www.pinknic.co.uk), was not able to be archived by the wayback machine though the wayback machine does tell us that the first attempted snapshot of the domain was April 21st 2017 which appears to be roughly when the website was first created though according to [domaintools.com](https://domainreport.domaintools.com/pinknic.co.uk) the domain name was first recorded as being registered on June 21st 2013. I did not want to spend 49$ to access the full report so unfortunately cannot provide more information than that.
