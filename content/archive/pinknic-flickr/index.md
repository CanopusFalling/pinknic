Sheffield Pinknic published two albums of photos on Flickr for the years 2015 and 2016. To See all the photos [got to the Sheffield Pinknic flickr page](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pinknicsheffield/).

I would like to archive these photos on this website as well and provide extended context to the images but we have been unable to contact Pinknic Sheffield who seem to hold the copyright, though it is uncertain if the copyright does actually belong to Sheffield Pinknic as the photos seem to come from a variety of different devices and may actually be the copyright of other attendees who simply shared their photos with Sheffield Pinknic. Unfortunately there is no good answer here, UK law is incredibly unfriendly to archival efforts.

This article will be modified as this changes. For now the only way to access these photos is through [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pinknicsheffield/).
