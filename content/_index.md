Sheffield Pinknic was a vibrant annual LGBT event in Sheffield, launched in 2013, with its last confirmed run in 2024. All available information suggests it is **not running in 2025** but I've been unable to confirm this with the organisers of the event.

I acquired pinknic.co.uk when it became unregistered, aiming to either return it to the original organisers or transform this site into a comprehensive archive of Pinknic's history if there was nobody left to take it back. I believe it's important to preserve the legacy of what was once Sheffield's largest yearly LGBT event and keep this site in place in case it should return.

Are you an organiser? I'd be delighted to return the domain to you and offer any assistance to help the event continue. Please [reach out](/contact).

In the meantime, I'm building a public archive of Pinknic information. If you have photos, stories, or anything to contribute, please [get in touch](/contact)!
