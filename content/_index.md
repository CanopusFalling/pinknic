Sheffield Pinknic is an event run by LGBT Sheffield, currently it is not known if it will run in the summer of 2025. This domain was left to be unregistered so I bought it up and am hosting this as a placeholder website. I intend to either get the domain back to the organisers or keep hold of it and turn this website into a blog about the history of the event so we don't loose the history.

If you are one of the organisers and would like this domain back or would like to get involved in creating a replacement to go here please reach out to me. I would love to interview people on their experiences with pinknic, how it was to run the event and what went into it each year.
