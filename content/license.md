This website is released under [The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org) which effectively releases all copyright and provides the website as public domain. You are free to do pretty much anything you like with the website. The goal is to make sure the information provided can be archived by anyone so we don't risk losing the history of Pinknic.

The website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which is under the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) and uses the theme [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) which is provided under the [MIT License](https://mit-license.org/).

You can download all of the website and code from [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/CanopusFalling/pinknic).

## License Exceptions

While most of the content is under [The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org) there are some notable exceptions where the copyright holders of some content could not be identified or where the copyright holders did not want to release the content as public domain.

- **[Archive/The Digital Remains Of Pinknic](/archive/the-digital-remains-of-pinknic/):** The article itself is still under [The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org) but many of the "digital remains" it features have unknown copyright holders, often due to their historical nature or the original creators being unidentifiable.

This website is a not-for-profit endeavor, created and maintained purely as an archival project to preserve the history of Pinknic by [Canopy Falls](https://canopyfalls.com/). It generates no revenue and serves solely as a public resource.

If you are a copyright holder of any content featured on this website (including but not limited to text, images, or multimedia) and wish for it to be removed, or if you are an individual featured in an image and would prefer it not to be displayed, please do not hesitate to [get in touch](/contact).

Upon receiving a request, I will promptly review the matter and take appropriate action, including the removal of the specified content, as quickly as possible. I hope any copyright holders will appreciate the not-for-profit nature of this website and the goal of preserving the history of the event.
