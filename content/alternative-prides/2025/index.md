> **Important Notice:** This website is being run by myself, [Canopy Falls](https://canopyfalls.com), while the Pinknic organisers have left the domain to be unregistered. I have attempted to contact the organisers multiple times but have not had any reply from them. This is not an endorsement of the prides listed below by myself and is definitely not an endorsement by the original organisers of Pinknic who have had no involvement. The goal is just to provide information about other events for those who may be missing Pinknic this year.

## Kelham Pride | 21st June

This event is a community-led celebration in the Kelham Island and Neepsend neighborhood, aiming to celebrate, support, and champion the LGBTQ+ community and its allies. It typically includes a parade, street party, live entertainment, and various activities across multiple venues, focusing on creating inclusive and respectful spaces. It is a not-for-profit event often involving local businesses and community groups.

## Sheffield Radical Pride | 5th July

This event is organized by queer activists with a focus on reclaiming Pride as a protest and a movement for civil rights. It emphasizes anti-corporate and anti-police stances, advocating for queer liberation and addressing systemic issues impacting the LGBTQ+ community, particularly trans rights. It operates without corporate or council funding and is volunteer-run.
