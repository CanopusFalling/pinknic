The Pinknic Archive is a not-for-profit passion project dedicated to preserving the rich history of Pinknic. It's an open, collaborative effort, and we welcome contributions from anyone who shares our goal. Your help ensures this unique piece of history remains accessible for years to come.

## How You Can Help

There are many ways to contribute, whether you have materials to share, historical knowledge, or simply time to offer:

- **Share Your Memories and Materials:** Do you have photos, videos, stories, flyers, tickets, or any other memorabilia from Pinknic events? We'd love to include them in the archive! Your personal collection could be a vital piece of the puzzle.
- **Identify Content:** If you recognize people in photos, know more details about specific events, or can provide context for any existing materials, your insights are incredibly valuable.
- **Correct Information:** Spotted an inaccuracy or a typo? Let us know! Maintaining accuracy is crucial for a historical archive.
- **Spread the Word:** Tell other Pinknic attendees or enthusiasts about this archive. The more people who know, the more likely we are to uncover lost history.
